# IDS_project - Real estate evaluator

#### Mihkel Maspanov, Samuel Kolsar, Robert Erik Pass

The goal of the project was to create and train a model to predict real estate asking prices and give the deal a rating.
We got the idea from a car website where it showed a value rating for each listing and decided this would be quite cool to replicate in real estate.


After cloning our code from the repository you can simply run the GUI by running all cells in the model.ipynb file.


Data.csv - Real estate listings scraped by the scraper.

model.ipynb - Contains the main code for the model (Cleaning data, training model, GUI).
